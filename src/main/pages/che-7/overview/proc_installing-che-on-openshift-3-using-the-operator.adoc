= Installing {prod-short} on OpenShift 3 using the Operator

This section describes how to install {prod-short} on OpenShift 3 with the CLI management tool to install via the Operator with SSL (HTTPS) enabled.

As of 2.1.1, SSL/TLS is enabled by default as it is required by the Che-Theia IDE.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of OpenShift 3.11.
* Administrator rights on this OpenShift 3 instance.
* The `oc` OpenShift 3.11 CLI management tool is installed and configured. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli[Installing the OpenShift 3.11 CLI]. To check the version of the `oc` tool, use the `oc version` command.
* The `{prod-cli}` CLI management tool is installed. See link:{prod-ig-url}#installing-the-{prod-cli}-management-tool[Installing the `{prod-cli}` CLI management tool].

.Procedure

. Log in to OpenShift. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login[Basic Setup and Login].
